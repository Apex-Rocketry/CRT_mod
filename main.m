        % import_eng is a custom script that imports data from a .eng file

        % the same directory from which the simulation is being run and wiithin this
        % function the user must specify the position of said motor within
        % the rocket having the foremost part of the rocket as a reference
        % point.

    %% Nose cone

        % to the function Barrowman_calc.m (works when using the customized
        % 'Functions' directory).
        % position for the nose cone should be zero. position always means

        % Cil = {'cylinder', surface, length, diameter, mass, position}
        % 'surface' is 'yes' if it forms part of the rocket's body

%% Customized Atmosphere with Interspersed Oscilations (CAIO_atmosphere)
    % The custom atmosphere model implemented here is based on a (very

    % atmospheric variables.
    
    %% Altitude vector

    %% INMET DATA
        % http://www.inmet.gov.br/portal/index.php?r=estacoes/estacoesAutomaticas

        % Given a launch site and a launch window, a sample of the relevant
        % atmospheric data should be taken for the closest meteorological
        % station to the launch site, using the past year's data for the
        % same dates determined by the launch window.
    
        % avg_wind_direction is the average (for all measurements within
        % the launch window) of the wind direction (relative to true
        % north) (INMET: Vento -> Dir.).
        
        % avg_temperature is the average (for all measurements within the
        % launch window) of the ground wind's mean temperature. (INMET:
        % Temperatura -> 0.5*(Min+Max)).
        
        % avg_windspeed is the average (for all measurements within the
        % launch window) of the mean wind velocity (INMET: Vento -> Vel.).
        
        % avg_windshear is the average (for all measurements within the
        % launch window) of the shear wind velocity (INMET: Vento -> Raj.).
 
    %% Reference Parameters
        % Parameters for the logarithm model of the atmosphere.
        
        % ref_height is the reference height at which ground velocity data
        % is know. Must be =/= 0, tipically 2m for INMET data.
        
        % ref_roughness is the friction coefficient between ground and
        % atmosphere. Typical value is ~0.1.
        % https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roughness_length
        
    
    %% Random Parameters
        % Parameters for the randomization of the atmospheric profiles.
        
        % rand_temperature is the maximum percentual variation allowed for
        % in the temperature value. The final temperature profile will
        % oscilate from it's average value randomly by this % factor.
        
        % rand_velocity is the maximum percentual variation allowed for in
        % the wind velocity profile.
        
        % rand_direction is the maximum dregrees (from true north)
        % variation allowed for in the wind direction profile.
